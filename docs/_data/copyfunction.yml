          You should have an instance with the docker image installed and Vitis-AI 1.4.1 Git repository cloned. If not done, then refer to [AWS_README](./setup_vitisai_awsf1.md).
          Open a terminal window after logging in into the instance.

          You can download model files (board specific pre-compiled or board independent source files) to run the available `downloader.py` located in `Vitis-AI_1_4_1/models/AI-Model-Zoo` directory."
  code: cd /home/ubuntu/Vitis-AI_1_4_1/models/AI-Model-Zoo/
